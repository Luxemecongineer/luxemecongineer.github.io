Hello! I am Sen Lu, an Assistant Professor in the School of Insurance at the Central University of Finance and Economics. My research fields are empirical industrial organization and applied microeconometrics. I work on the structural estimation of firm competition and matching games, with applications to spectrum-license mergers, cooperative pharmaceutical R&D, insurance demand, the thoroughbred breeding market, etc. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Rice University in 2024.
